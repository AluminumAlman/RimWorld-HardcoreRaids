Inspired by Combat Extended's old patches to raids. Makes raids harder by adjusting what raids RimWorld already offers. Expect to have !!FUN!!.

Exact changes:
 - Destructive patch to make all factions have 1 to 1 points to pawn cost curve (mechanoid raids should be x10 harder, for example).
 - Raid letters no longer tell what's the raid strategy for more drama (except for stage then attack raids, those are way too easy).
 - Raid strategies change with how many raid points are used. At the start they'll use stage then attack or normal immediate attacks, at the end of the curve: sieges, smart breachers, immediate and sapper center drop raids (say goodbye to your killboxes, casuals).
 - Expect for easier raids coming from drop pods, as the cost of sending them out affects how many raiders can appear in them (not by a whole lot, though).
 
Prefferably loaded last, as this mod is just a collection of patches, but before other mods which ask to be loaded last.
