	<description>Inspired by Combat Extended's old patches to raids. Makes raids harder by adjusting what raids RimWorld already offers. Expect to have !!FUN!!.\n\nExact changes:\n • Destructive patch to make all factions have 1 to 1 points to pawn cost curve (mechanoid raids should be x10 harder, for example).\n • Raid letters no longer tell what's the raid strategy for more drama (except for stage then attack raids, those are way too easy).\n • Raid strategies change with how many raid points are used. At the start they'll use stage then attack or normal immediate attacks, at the end of the curve: sieges, smart breachers, immediate and sapper center drop raids (say goodbye to your killboxes, casuals).\n • Expect for easier raids coming from drop pods, as the cost of sending them out affects how many raiders can appear in them (not by a whole lot, though).\n\nPrefferably loaded last, as this mod is just a collection of patches, but before other mods which ask to be loaded last..</description>
